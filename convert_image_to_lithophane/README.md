Usage:

(base-64 encoded jpeg image string) | python convert_image_to_lithophane.py

STDOUT:
(base-64 encoded JPEG image string of lithophane preview)


Description:
Python script for converting a base-64 encoded JPEG image as a string, piped in from standard input, to a simulated lithophane backlit with incandescent lighting, piped out into standard output as a base-64 encoded JPEG image as a string

Lithophanes are 3D-Dimensional piece of artwork where the raised areas create darker spaces when illuminated from behind.

The script functions by converting the string to an image object with a grayscale-pallet of 12 colors, and assigns each pixel a new value based on its X-Y coordinate position in relation to the relevant image in folder ./image_keys

Image keys were generated by 3D-printing sheets in PLA (poly-lactic acid) of thicknesses varying from 0.2 mm to 2.4 mm and photographing the sheet as illuminated by incandescent lighting from behind
